#  Ifconfig Bash Script

This bash script fetches connectivity parameters of all available interfaces at runtime. The user may select the information they want to check, such as the IPv4 address of their Wi-Fi interface, and it will be displayed to them. This script provides an interface that simplifies the process of checking your device's connectivity, as you can enter exactly what you need to see instead of going through the entirety of the "ifconfig" command.
